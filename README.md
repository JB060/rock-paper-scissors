- <strong>CSS3</strong>: For styling and layout.
- <strong>JavaScript</strong>: For game logic and interactivity.

### Frameworks, Libraries, and Programs Used:
- <strong>Bootstrap<strong>: For responsive design and layout.
- <strong>FontAwesome</strong>: For icons used in the game.
- <strong>Google Fonts</strong>: For typography.
- <strong>jQuery</strong>: For simplifying JavaScript code.
- <strong>GitHub</strong>: For version control and project hosting.
  
# Bugs
 1. <strong>Incorrect Winner Determination:</strong>
  - <strong>Bug:</strong> The app sometimes declared the wrong winner, especially in edge cases where the user input was not properly validated.
  - <strong>Fix:</strong> Improved the game logic to handle all possible outcomes correctly and added additional validation for user input.
2. <strong>Unresponsive User Interface:</strong>
 - <strong>Bug:</strong> The UI would become unresponsive after multiple rounds of the game.
 - <strong>Fix:</strong> Optimized the event handling and ensured proper cleanup of resources after each game round.
3. <strong>Score Reset Issue:</strong>
 - <strong>Bug:</strong> The score counter was not resetting correctly when a new game session started.
 - <strong>Fix:</strong> Implemented proper state management to reset the score and game state at the start of each new session.
4. <strong>Crash on Invalid Input:</strong>
 - <strong>Bug:</strong> The app would crash if the user entered an invalid move (anything other than rock, paper, or scissors).
 - <strong>Fix:</strong> Added input validation to handle invalid entries gracefully and prompt the user to enter a valid move.

# Testing
### Tools Testing
- <strong>Lighthouse: Check performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
- <strong>W3C Validators</strong>: HTML and CSS validation for code quality.
  
# Manual Testing
- <strong>Cross-Browser Testing</strong>: Ensured compatibility across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- <strong>Device Testing</strong>: Verified functionality on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
- <strong>Functional Testing</strong>: Checked that all buttons, game logic, and feedback mechanisms work as expected.
  
# Finished Product
- The finished Rock-Paper-Scissors game is fully functional and responsive, providing a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface and real-time feedback. Screenshots and live demo links are available in the project repository.

# Improvements 
<strong>The game at the minute is functional, but lacks a theme, I would like to make the following improvements in the future to make the game a lot better for users:</strong>
  
<strong>Game Modes:</strong>
 - Single Player: Play against the computer.
 - Multiplayer: Two players can play against each other on the same machine.
 - Online Multiplayer: Implement online multiplayer functionality.
      
<strong> AI Enhancements:</strong>
 - Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels by varying the computerâ€™s strategy.
 - Learning AI: Implement a learning algorithm where the computer improves its strategy based on past games.

<strong>Statistics:</strong>
 - Score Tracking: Keep track of scores across multiple rounds.
 - Game History: Display the history of moves and outcomes.

<strong>Gameplay Variations:</strong>
 - Extended Choices: Include additional choices like Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
 - Custom Rules: Allow users to create their own rules or variations.

# Deployment:
